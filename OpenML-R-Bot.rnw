\section{Introduction}

In this paper we describe how experiments with the random bot were executed on OpenML (cite XXX). 

\section{Description of the bot}

We specified six machine learning algorithms with their specific hyperparameters.
We choosed the six supervised learning algorithms elastic net (\texttt{glmnet} package), 
decision tree (\texttt{rpart}), k-nearest neighbors (\texttt{kknn}), 
support vector machines (\texttt{svm}), random forest (\texttt{ranger}) 
and gradient boosting (\texttt{xgboost}). They represent algorithms that are used very 
often and cover a broad range of different types of algorithms. 
The algorithms with their specific hyperparameters and hyperparameter constraints can 
be found in table XXX. Some hyperparameters are transformed after they have been drawn, 
for example to get more results in regions where we expect more interesting results. 

Furthermore we choosed the classification tasks (datasets) from the OpenML100 
Benchmarksuite (cite XXX) as benchmark datasets, only including datasets without 
missing data. The datasets with their specific characteristics can be found in table XXX. 

The bot then essentially does the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Randomly draw one of the six algorithms
\item Randomly draw a hyperparameter setting of the chosen algorithms
\item Randomly draw one of the benchmark datasets
\item Download the dataset from OpenML
\item Benchmark the specified algorithm on the specified dataset with 10-fold cross-validation
\item Upload the benchmark results with time measurements to OpenML with the 
identification tag \texttt{mlrRandomBot}
\end{enumerate}

The code for the bot can be found on github (XXX), the packages \texttt{mlr} (CITE XXX) 
and \texttt{OpenML} (CITE XXX) were used for the whole process. 

In total we executed around 6 millions (XXX) runs of the random bot on different 
server platforms (OH NO!) like Azure.

\section{Access to the benchmark results}

The results of the benchmarks can be accessed in different ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item The easiest way to access them is to go to the figshare repository (XXX) and
download the .RData or the .csv file. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Validity of the results}

DISTRIBUTION OF HYPERPARAMETERS AND DATASETS

\section{Potential usage of the results}

The results can be used to discover effects of the hyperparameters on performances 
of the different algorithms on different datasets. 

This can be used to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Find good defaults for the algorithms that work well on many datasets
\item Measure differences between the algorithms
\item Optimize tuning algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure the tunability of algorithms and find out which parameters should be tuned
\item Use the results to get priors for tuning algorithms - in which regions of the 
hyperparameter space should be searched with higher probability?
\end{itemize}
\item Meta-Learning: Train models that based on dataset characteristics and 
possibly time limitations propose hyperparameter settings that perform good 
on a specific dataset
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Think about the title
\item Put the package on CRAN
\item Put the database on e.g. figshare
